# typescript-typeorm-graphql

This is a simple backend project that uses typeORM, MySQL, and Graphql. It focuses on learning the basics of each technology.

With it, you can create a list of products. Also, you can delete them and update them.

Feel free to use it and make a proper front end. Maybe a shopping list, who knows!
